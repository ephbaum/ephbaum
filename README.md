# Welcome

Welcome to my WIP Readme.md file! Here's some nonsense about me:

## Why Eph Baum?

As you may guess, I was not born Eph Baum.

I am Eph

There are likely many other Ephs, but I'm the only Eph that is me (I'm definitely not [Steve}(https://youtu.be/5vtZcojS9KA), despite my given middle name)

Here is the journey of taking my given name and condensing it down into something that actually represents me:

As I mentioned, I was not born Eph Baum.

Instead, I was given a first name I was told not to use. I was directed, instead, to use my middle name as my primary name.

Unfortunately middle name has a few issues: it uses a less common and less popular spelling of a very common name , when coupled with as first name easily conformed to various jokes while simultaneously being very uncommon. Even though I generally didn't use that name, if a bully found it out, they would invariably try to us it against me. So, teasing. Finally there's my given last name, which I actually don't hate, it's just one of those long German last names that is 10 letters long.

#### Dear F.,

This is how emails and messages often arrive to me, the output of scripts that just don't know how to handle my name:

> Hello F!

> F your experience really impressed me!

> F., I hope this message finds you well!

It's Eph, actually

For years I have used my first initial for most systems and frequently found that it's pretty common that systems aren't build for a traditional `first_name + " " + last_name` expectation.

I have thousands of emails addressed to some variation of the letter F.
`F19baum`, `F21baum` with spaces

Between the first letter of my first name: F, and the end of my last name: baum, there are 19 letters; there are twenty-one if you include non-printing characters. And three of them in the middle of my middle name are: EPH.

These two points, however, have become commonly use for a "nickname":

### `F-baum`, the co-worker

Co-workers, and friends, have called me `F-baum` for most of my life, siezing first initial and end of my last name; as well as my propensity for vulgarity. `K-Baum` was common too. 

I actually kind of like this guy: `F-baum` the co-worker

## So, seriously, what's the deal?

I've been through a great many transformations over the years. I've learned a lot about myself and what got me to where I am. I've learned to face my past but move forward. I've come to think of my given name as my dead name and Eph Baum as my new identity. So much so that I've decided that I would like to legally change my name.

It's important to me to live my authentic self and this is one way of doing exactly that.
