- 👋 Hi, I’m @fskirschbaum
  - I go by Eph Baum now, which is a sort of Ship of Theseus thing at this point
- 👀 I’m interested in:
  - outside (hiking, backpacking, trail running, adventuring, etc.)
  - healthy living through
    - eating whole foods
    - exercise & weight training
    - stretching, yoga, qigong
    - mindfulness, meditation
    - journaling, reflection, gratitude
  - building a life for my family, and myself, here in the beautiful PNW
- 🌱 I’m currently learning
  - how to better take care of myself and the people around me
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on 
  - anything related to the above
  - anything that could ultimately make the world a better place for us all
