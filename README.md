# Welcome

Welcome to my WIP Readme.md file! Here's some nonsense:

### Why Eph Baum?

As you may guess, I was not born Eph Baum. 

#### I'm Eph!

There are many probably other Ephs, but I'm the only Eph that is me (I'm definitely not [Steve](https://youtu.be/5vtZcojS9KA), despite my given middle name)

As you might have guessed, I was not born Eph Baum

Instead, I was given a name I was told not to use. Directed, instead, to use my middle name as my primary name. This was fine enough as my given first name easily conformed to various jokes. Even though I generally didn't use that name, if a bully found it out, it would invariably be used against me. My middle name was not great either as it used a less common, less popular, spelling of a very common name ultimately leading to additional teasing. Finally there's my given last name, which I actually don't hate, it's just one of those long German last names at 10 letters long.

#### Dear F.,

> Hello F! | F., I hope this message finds you well!

It's Eph, actually

For years I have used my first initial for most systems and frequently found that it's pretty common that systems aren't build for a traditional first_name + " " + last_name expectation.

I have thousands of emails addressed to F.

#### F19baum, F21baum with spaces
Between the first letter of my first name: F, and the end of my last name: baum, there are 19 letters; there are twenty-one if you include non-printing characters.

These two points, however, have become commonly picked upon for a "nickname":

#### F-baum, the co-worker

Co-workers have called me F-baum for many years, siezing first initial and last name.

I actually kind of like this guy, f-baum the co-worker 

### So, seriously, what's the deal?

I've been through a great many transformations over the years. I've learned a lot about myself and what got me to where I am. I've learned to face my past and move forward. I've come to think of my given name as my dead name and Eph Baum as my new identity. So much so that I've decided that I would like to legally change my name. 

It's important to me to live my authentic self and this is one way of doing exactly that.
